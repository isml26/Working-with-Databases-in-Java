# Some of the most popular tools for working with databases in Java
[Spring Data JPA](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/)
- is a high-level API that provides an object-relational mapping (ORM) layer between Java
    objects and database tables. 
- It is built on top of JDBC and provides a number of features
    that make it easier to work with databases, such as automatic mapping of Java objects to
    database tables and support for complex queries.

[JDBC](https://www.oracle.com/tr/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc.html) 
- is the standard API for connecting to and interacting with databases from Java. 
- It is a low-level API, but it is very flexible and can be used with any database.

[Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/) 
- is an open-source ORM framework that provides a number of features that make it easier to work with databases, such as
automatic mapping of Java objects to database tables, caching of database queries, and support for
complex queries.

[MyBatis ](https://mybatis.org/mybatis-3/) 
- is an open-source SQL mapper framework that allows you to map SQL queries to Java objects. This can make it easier to
work with SQL in your Java applications.
